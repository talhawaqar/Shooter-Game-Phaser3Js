## Game Development

- ### Ideation

  During the planning phase of the game, I was faced with the conundrum of recognizing that there are plenty of shooter games out there most of which share the same ideas. Therefore I decided to proceed with the idea of making a space shooter game that contains a jet in space shoot enemies and collect coins to make the score

- ## Designing

  Designing is a very important part of game development. I found the space image on the Phaser website. I get this image and edited according to my need and rotate it on y-axes infinitely to give the effect you are actually in space. I find jet image ammo image and blast sprite from code4cause it looks perfect for me so I used it. The buttons and the loading design are the same provided in the getting started template by Zenva.

- ## Development

  Working with Phaser 3 is awesome. At first, it looks weird but by watching tutorials and follow the getting started guide provided by the phaser I found it very interesting and after some time, I think it is time to make my own game.

  I listed the main features I wanted in my game and designed them following the Phaser 3 documentation.

  Breifly, below are the steps I followed in development:

  - Install Phaser using Node Package Manager(npm) and set up the game configuration.

  - Design the Game scene by implementing the following:

    1. Use template provided by Zenava.
    1. Use rotated tiled background of space image.
    1. Find jet and ammo image and allow jet to fire ammo.
    1. Find bomb image and sprite shows when bomb explode.
    1. Add scouring system.
    1. Use microverse provided api to keep record of the scores.
    1. Make object to show leaderboard score.

  - Design other supplimentary scenes.
  - Add sound to the game.
  - Add and implement the Leader Board functionality using the scoring api.
  - Finalise.

- ## Deployment
  The game is deployed on netlify.
